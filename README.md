# Smart-Mirror #
### Raspberry powered mirror which can display news, weather, calendar events ###

We used a see through mirror along with a monitor in order to make the smart mirror.
This mirror incorporates a PIR sensor to detect movement in front of mirror, allowing 
the mirror to display information only if theres someone standing in front of it.

In the project directory execute:
```
smartmirror.sh
```
to get the whole system started.

### NOTE: Display layout may change depending on the dimension of monitor used. ###
